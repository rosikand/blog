# Sorting first layer of neural network

### Variable change that is being tested:

What happens if we sort the first input layer of a neural network? Would accuracy improve? What happens if we sort from greatest to least vs. least to greatest? 

**Research question**: Can statistically-learned inference for image classification transfer across a uniform redistribution of pixels?

### Data Analysis

Take this data point of a 5 in the MNIST dataset:

Now see what happens when we apply a uniform redistribution of pixels by sorting the pixel values in the image row-wise:
