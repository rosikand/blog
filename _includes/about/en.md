Hi! My name is Rohan Sikand and I am an undergraduate student at Stanford University studying Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. I plan to use this blog to share what I learn along the way, as well as a space for my thoughts. I am going to update this 'about' biography page sometime soon, so in the meanwhile, enjoy some ASCII art courtesy of Stanford:

      _____  _               __              _
      / ____| |             / _|            | |
     | (___ | |_ __ _ _ __ | |_ ___  _ __ __| |
      \___ \| __/ _` | '_ \|  _/ _ \| '__/ _` |
      ____) | || (_| | | | | || (_) | | | (_| |
     |_____/ \__\__,_|_| |_|_| \___/|_|  \__,_|


Some things to add: 
- A link to personal website (and SNS logo in footer on all pages) 
- SEO stuff 
- Add Disqus or Utterance comments (or https://fastcomments.com/) 
- Profile picture 
- Fix search tool 
- Categories along with tags 


Side note: As I sift through my thoughts and notes regarding what to write/post to this blog, I seem to have a fundamental concern to which I cannot answer to: I have ideas for longer posts, but I also want to be able to post shorter microblog like thoughts. Should I separate those two and have them linked in two different places respectively? Or do I just use this blog as a sort of inbox for all my internal writings no matter the category? My initial thought is to have essentially two separate feeds under one link. I am not sure yet so I may experiment with a little bit of everything.
