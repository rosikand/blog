Hi! My name is Rohan Sikand and I am an undergraduate student at Stanford University studying Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. I plan to use this blog to share what I learn along the way, as well as a space for my thoughts. I am going to update this 'about' biography page sometime soon, so in the meanwhile, enjoy some ASCII art courtesy of Stanford:

      _____  _               __              _

Some things to add: 
- an interactive page/spreadsheet that visitors of this site can sign 
- A link to personal website (and SNS logo in footer on all pages) 
- SEO stuff 
- Add Disqus comments 
- Profile picture
