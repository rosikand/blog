# Rohan Sikand's Blog
This repository is used to store the source code of my blog and and host it blog at [rosikand.github.io/blog](https://rosikand.github.io/blog) through Github Pages. 

I plan to use this blog to share what I learn along the way, as well as a space for my thoughts. 

The site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the theme used is [Hux Blog](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io).
